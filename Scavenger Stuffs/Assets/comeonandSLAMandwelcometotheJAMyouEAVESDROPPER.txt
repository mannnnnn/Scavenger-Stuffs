"Tell ** you saw ******** away **** as I-?"
"****'s balls, what happened?"
"Yes, *********** didn't go well. Why ****** let her?"
"Even I could have told you ********, and ******** she's lying! Give me ********* come back."
*some unsavory cursing*


"The anti-magic potion has *******. I'll wait the week, pick it up, then ****** if it works."
"I know. *********! But if it is, if it is then we ********* she's ready again and we go get Kida. We use a quarter of the potion ****** time."
"Why *****? Because he knows what to do! You're insane and you're playing ******** to goddamn sword of the north! You aren't a healer, you aren't in your right mind, and I need you ******* with circumnavigating this ********."

"She's fine. How would you know anyways? She's fine, she was joking with me when I first woke ****."
"She's dedicated. I'm fine, and I was there for three goddamn years, Tai. She ********* seconds."

*annoyed huff*

"Like I'd be able to tell. It's your job *******, I don't know what I'd act out like. You know **** I see now."
"*****************, I had to look for something new, besides that ugly bastard's mug."
"The tree is nearby, I could make ***********. Maybe it's a book, maybe it's the deer."
"I don't want to. Seams are not meant to be walked, ****** are the weak part. That's why we have the tree."
"Absolutely."

"No, I stand by my word that it should have been Kida freed, but you are doing fine in his stead."
"This is my only second chance. Do you think I wanted to sit and wallow in what could have been? He's strong, he'd take it in anyone's place."


"I'd weather it for any of you, even if I hadn't said to attack the giant. There's no-"
"Angle?"
"Bloody hell-"
